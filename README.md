# Codex Orchestration

Bring models like Claude Fable 5 into Codex, give them roles, and make them work together.

## What does it do?

Codex Orchestration turns one Codex task into a multi-model workflow.

- Bring Fable 5 or another compatible model into Codex.
- Assign roles such as advisor, executor, researcher, writer, designer, or reviewer.
- Choose the order in which those roles work.
- Let Codex manage the handoffs and return one verified result.

The model selected for the task stays in charge. It plans, decides what feedback to use, delegates work, tests the result, and gives you the final answer.

## How it works

Here is one example:

```text
                 YOUR TASK OR GOAL
                         |
                         v
              SOL — ROOT ORCHESTRATOR
                    creates the plan
                         |
                         v
              FABLE 5 — PLAN ADVISOR
                 finds gaps and risks
                         |
                         v
              SOL — ROOT ORCHESTRATOR
             improves the plan and decides
                         |
              +----------+----------+
              |                     |
              v                     v
       LUNA EXECUTOR 1        LUNA EXECUTOR 2
          builds a part          builds a part
              |                     |
              +----------+----------+
                         |
                         v
              SOL — ROOT ORCHESTRATOR
                 tests and delivers
```

You choose the models, roles, and order. Codex follows the workflow while keeping final decisions with the root model.

## Why use it?

- **Better plans:** Fable 5 can challenge the root model before implementation begins.
- **More perspectives:** use different models for planning, research, design, writing, review, or execution.
- **Faster implementation:** independent executors can work in parallel—up to 2x faster on suitable tasks.
- **Less limit pressure:** move repeated implementation work away from the root model and potentially hit premium-model limits about 40% less often.

Results depend on the models, task, context, retries, and how much work can run in parallel. The speed and limit figures are targets, not guarantees.

## Install

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add Cjbuilds/Codex-Orchestration
codex plugin add codex-orchestration@codex-orchestration
```

Start a new Codex task after installation so the plugin loads.

Setup requires Python 3.11 or newer.

## Quick start with Fable 5

Select the model you want to lead the task, then run:

```text
/codex-orchestration setup executor: GPT-5.6 Luna Extra High, advisor: Claude Fable 5 Extra High
```

This creates the default workflow:

```text
Selected Codex model -> Fable 5 review -> selected model decides -> Luna executes -> selected model verifies
```

Fable 5 uses the official Claude Code CLI. The default route uses a compatible first-party Claude login. An explicitly selected `cc-switch-openrouter-loopback` transport can instead use an existing Claude Code → CC Switch → OpenRouter configuration. You do not need to add an Anthropic API key to Codex, and the loopback transport does not copy the OpenRouter key into Codex state.

After setup, start another new task and work normally.

## Tell Codex your workflow

Paste a workflow at the start of a task:

```text
Use this workflow:

1. The selected model is the root orchestrator and creates the plan.
2. Claude Fable 5 reviews the plan as advisor.
3. The root accepts only useful feedback and improves the plan.
4. Luna executors build independent parts in parallel.
5. The root integrates, tests, and verifies the final result.
```

You can change the sequence for any task:

```text
Researcher -> root synthesis -> designer -> writer -> reviewer -> root verification
```

## Bring another model into Codex

Ask Codex Orchestration to create a role:

```text
/codex-orchestration create these project roles:

- researcher
  model: <model-id>
  provider: <configured-provider-id>
  effort: high
  job: gather evidence and cite sources

- writer
  model: <model-id>
  effort: medium
  job: turn approved research into a clear draft

- designer
  model: <model-id>
  effort: high
  job: propose and review the user experience
```

Codex previews the role files before creating them. Project roles live in `.codex/agents/`. Personal roles live in `~/.codex/agents/` and can be used across projects.

Fable 5 is currently bundled as a plan advisor. Other models must already be available through Codex or an authenticated, compatible provider.

## Use it with Codex Goals

Set a Goal normally, then add your workflow:

```text
/goal Ship the authentication redesign with tests and migration notes.

Use my Fable advisor and Luna executor workflow until the Goal is complete.
```

Codex still owns the Goal. The plugin controls the model workflow inside it.

## Useful commands

```text
/codex-orchestration status
/codex-orchestration status --require-effective
/codex-orchestration setup executor: GPT-5.6 Luna Extra High, advisor: Claude Fable 5 Extra High
/codex-orchestration disable
```

`disable` restores the Codex routing values that existed before setup. It does not delete user-owned custom roles.

## Important limits

- Codex remains the root orchestrator.
- Fable 5 is a root-facing plan advisor, not a second orchestrator.
- Other providers must already be configured and authenticated.
- The plugin never creates credentials or bypasses permissions and approvals.
- Codex decides when delegation or parallel work is useful.
- If you say `no subagents`, Codex must not delegate.

Technical details are in [providers and models](plugins/codex-orchestration/skills/codex-orchestration/references/providers-and-models.md).

## Update

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade codex-orchestration
codex plugin add codex-orchestration@codex-orchestration
```

Start a new task after updating.

## Uninstall

First run:

```text
/codex-orchestration disable
```

Then remove the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin remove codex-orchestration@codex-orchestration
codex plugin marketplace remove codex-orchestration
```

Review and remove any user-owned custom roles separately.
