# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — Unreleased

- Add Claude Fable 5 as an opt-in, root-only advisor through a bundled local MCP bridge to the authenticated Claude Code CLI.
- Add explicit `subscription`, `api`, and fail-closed `auto` Fable authentication modes with non-secret API-source selection, while keeping credentials out of routing state and tool results.
- Add an explicit `direct-api` Fable transport that sends one strict Anthropic-compatible Messages request without requiring Claude Code or a subscription; keep the existing `claude-code` transport as the backward-compatible default and never fall back between them.
- Explicitly enable multi-agent v2 and migrate the incompatible legacy `agents.max_threads` limit to the v2 session limit while preserving disable restoration.
- Keep every Fable launcher disabled by default, enable only one compatible Python 3.11+ route, and restore prior plugin overrides on disable.
- Pin every Claude Code model slot to `claude-fable-5`, suppress the Haiku-backed automatic session-title request, omit model fallback, disable tools and session persistence, and fail closed unless runtime `modelUsage` contains only Fable.
- Add automation-safe native status gating with `--require-effective`.
- Detect orphaned managed personal roles and distinguish installed policy from live route validation.
- Fail truthfully when restore-state persistence and config rollback do not both succeed.
- Exercise direct-model lifecycle setup and add macOS/Windows portability checks.
- Pin GitHub Actions, add CodeQL and Dependabot, and document secure contribution and release workflows.
- Clarify policy-guided routing, concurrency, Windows custom-role limitations, and two-phase recovery.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-10

- Make one-time, config-first routing the primary workflow: setup once, then use Codex normally.
- Add native setup, status, update, and disable through Codex App Server's atomic config API.
- Route same-provider executors with exact model, effort, and `fork_turns = "none"` inputs.
- Keep the selected task model as root orchestrator and let Codex decide whether delegation helps.
- Make the advisor truly optional: omission now means `none`.
- Preserve custom agents as the durable and cross-provider route.
- Give personal provider-pinned roles stable home-specific names and reject missing or project-shadowed agent routes.
- Capability-test the active, PATH, known Desktop, and explicitly supplied Codex clients before writing newer fields.
- Configure and restore `tool_namespace = "agents"` for the validated v2 route; live Desktop testing showed the default `collaboration` namespace rejected expanded model metadata while `agents` spawned Luna at `xhigh`.
- Clarify that metadata visibility plus the `agents` namespace exposes the needed controls but still does not choose Luna; `usage_hint_text` supplies the executor route.
- Keep the unnecessary Sol/Terra v2 force flag omitted.
- Preserve unrelated TOML, comments, concurrency settings, and pre-setup routing values on disable.
- Add native-policy setup/restore lifecycle validation plus generated routing-contract tests.
- Rewrite the README, ASCII flow, role explanations, config-only comparison, compatibility guidance, and savings claim in plain language.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-10

- Treat the current Codex task model as the only orchestrator.
- Add an optional root-facing plan advisor with bounded approval signals.
- Replace generic role layers with namespaced standalone Codex custom agents.
- Keep normal persistence out of `.codex/config.toml`.
- Add opt-in, backup-first migration for every previous published format.
- Distinguish prompt preferences, loaded pins, unavailable routes, and confirmed child models.
- Add project/personal provider boundaries, symlink/hard-link and collision protection, catalog provenance, timeouts, secret-redacted previews, atomic metadata-preserving swaps, directory fsyncs, and content-free crash-recovery journals.
- Add preview-first removal for fully managed saved roles without touching root configuration.
- Rewrite installation, invocation, role explanations, savings math, and the ASCII workflow for normal users.
- Add CI, packaging checks, contract tests, model-inspection tests, and a real Git-backed install/upgrade/runtime lifecycle smoke.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-09

- Added the optional advisor workflow.
- Kept Plan, Goal, delegation, integration, and verification under Codex control.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-09

- Initial Codex-Orchestration release.
